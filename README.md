### Hi, I am beginner frontend developer.

My name is Maksim. Of course, you could see it in my profile. But I don't mind reminding you of this again.

Today, and probably tomorrow, I'm studying in [Rolling Scopes FE course](https://rs.school/js/ "You can sign up too").

In this course, I gain practical skills in frontend development.

I have already completed the initial stage, which is called **Stage0**.
